Programming Project #1 for CSci 112.

CSCI 112: Programming project 1

Due Date: July 2’nd by 11:59 pm 

You will write a program to keep up with national league baseball teams (The teams can be real baseball teams or not, the players can be real or not) using OOP. The important aspect of object-oriented programming is modular development and testing of reusable software modules.

You will have a baseball player class, which consists of a player’s name, batting average (this can be an integer or double you decide, however if it’s an integer you will need to include a “.” when you print the value), and what position the player plays on the field. You will need a team class, which consists of the team’s name, an Array (default size of 10) of baseball players, and a count of how many players’ is on each team. Your driver will consist of an ArrayList of the teams that can hold 10 teams.

All the data for the teams and players are to be hard coded (Do Not ask the user for that data). The only thing to ask the user for is his/her name “as commissioner” of the league, with an appropriate welcoming.

Your program will need to:
- Print all the teams and the players (as well as all the data for each player) that go along with each team, (You will need a toString method) and the number of players per team.
- Sort the players in ascending order by batting average.
- Print the players with a batting average over .300 for each team. If no one on a team has a batting average over .300 you should have an appropriate message saying so (Hint: to make sure your program tests all possibilities, there should be one team that does not have any players’ that has a batting average over .300).
- Calculate and print each teams batting average.

To ensure your program works properly you will need at least 3 teams with at least 5 players per team. The player’s positions can be abbreviated such as SS for shortstop, 1B for first base, or LF for left field.

*No late programs will be accepted. If your program does not compile, it will not receive any credit. If you need help, come see me during my office hours, make an appointment with me, or speak to a TA in the labs on Sun – Thur from 5 – 8 pm.
